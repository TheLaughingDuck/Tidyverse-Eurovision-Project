# Tidyverse-Eurovision-Project
Final project in a University course on data management in R, specifically with Tidyverse.

In the project I used webscraping and a company API to obtain data on Eurovision Song Contest Entries throughout it's history. The main scope of the project was obtaining and wrangling data, but there is some data visualisation at the end of the report.
